# Background

Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from my [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim 
ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

WHERE 
    job_country = 'Poland' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
### Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Salary Distribution:** The salaries for these data analyst roles range from $111,175.0 to $165,000.0 annually.

- **Diverse Industry Representation:** Data analysts are in demand across multiple industries like energy, finance, advertising, and logistics.

- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Data Architect, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
    SELECT 
        job_id,
        name AS company_name,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim 
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

    WHERE 
        job_work_from_home = 'True' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:

- SQL is leading with a bold count of 8.
- Python follows closely with a bold count of 7.
- Tableau is also highly sought after, with a bold count of 6.

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_country = 'Poland'
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```

- **SQL** and **Excel** remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.

| Power BI  | 644          |

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS average_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_country = 'Poland'
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY average_salary DESC
LIMIT 25
```
